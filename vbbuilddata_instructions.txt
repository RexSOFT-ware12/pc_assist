For the build instructions......
1. Create a Type that is one line of the build instructions
Type BuildInst_OneLine
     Description       String
     Module             Integer
     Pin                    Integer
     Color                *****          (we could either store the hex color value or integer for our custom list)
     Trigger              Integer     (index to our custom list of trigger conditions)
End Type

2. Create an array of BuildInst_OneLine
I forget the syntax, but it would be something like....
Dim BuildInst( ) as BuildInst_OneLine

The Index to array BuildInst would be (step # - 1).  So the build instructions for step #1 would be.....
BuildInst[0].Description
BuildInst[0].Module
BuildInst[0].Pin
BuildInst[0].Color
BuildInst[0].Trigger


For the remaining part data, I would either create separate variables or combine everything with a Type structure.
1. Separate
PartNumber, Slot1, Slot2, Slot3, Slot4, Slot5, Slot6    (all as strings)
Continuity(next button), Tug(previous)    (all as boolean)

2. As a Type structure
Type PartData
     PN                    String
     Slot1                 String
     Slot2                 String
     Slot3                 String
     Slot4                 String
     Slot5                 String
     Slot6                 String
     Continuity         Boolean
     TugTest            Boolean
     BuildInst           BuildInst      (the array of build instructions)
End Type


If the type structure is used, everything is compact, but has longer variable names.  A build instruction element would be something like.....
PartData.BuildInst[2].Description     (screen description for step #3)
